# Enhancing-performance-of-big-data-machine-learning-models-on-Google-Cloud-Platform
A comprehensive in-depth analysis of the effect of parallelisation on the performance of various Cluster configurations in terms of CPU/Memory utilisation, Disk I/O operations and Network bandwidth . The project also experiments with different VM configurations and distribution strategies to analyse the more efficient combination for training the ML model.

Dataset -
A public dataset “Flowers” (3600 images, 5 classes) is used for the analysis.

About the project -
The project is focused on parallelising pre-processing, measuring and machine learning in the cloud, as well as the evaluation and analysis of the cloud performance.
